Rune's Particle System - Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use WinZip or a similar program to unzip the files. Unzip them to the
include folder that is in your POV-Ray folder, for example:

C:\Program Files\POV-Ray 3.5\Include\

Now the include file will be placed in its own folder inside the
include folder, like this:

C:\Program Files\POV-Ray 3.5\Include\particle\

In order to be able to use the files in any scene file, you need to
add the path to your master povray.ini file.

In POV-Ray for Windows, click the Tools menu and select
"Edit master POVRAY.INI". At the bottom of the text file, add this:

Library_Path=C:\Program Files\POV-Ray 3.5\Include\particles

You may need to change the line a bit to reflect the actual folder
names used on your system.

For further information about the particle system, please refer to
the documentation file which is included in the package.
The documentation is in the file doc/particle.html
